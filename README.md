# üéÆ Virtuous Portals

Welcome to my collection of browser-based games and educational demos! This repo is basically my digital playground where I've built some classic games and thrown in a security awareness demo for good measure.

## üïπÔ∏è The Games

### Snake Game (`snake.html`)
Remember the good old days of Nokia phones? Yeah, this is that Snake game but with modern web tech. Guide your snake around the screen, eat the food, grow longer, and try not to crash into yourself (easier said than done).

- Score tracking with local storage for bragging rights
- Mobile-friendly controls because nobody wants to be stuck at a desktop

- Increasing difficulty levels that will test your reflexes
- Line clearing with satisfying animations
- High score tracking (locally stored)

### Pong (`pong.html`)
The granddaddy of video games! This is digital ping-pong at its finest. You vs. the computer in an epic battle of paddle reflexes.

**Features:**
- Classic Pong gameplay with modern polish
- AI opponent that actually puts up a fight
- Particle effects because everything's better with particles
- Score tracking (first to... well, you decide when to quit)

### HackerTyper Knockoff (`hackertyper.html`)
Ever wanted to look like a movie hacker? This is your chance! Just start typing and watch as "sophisticated" hacking code appears on screen. Perfect for pranking friends or feeling like you're in The Matrix.

**Features:**
- Realistic-looking terminal interface
- Auto-generates "hacking" code as you type
- Full-screen mode for maximum effect
- Mobile keyboard support

## üîí Educational Content

### WiFi Security Alert (`wifi-security.html`)
This isn't a game, but it's probably the most important file here. It's an educational page about WiFi security that looks like one of those scary warning pages you might encounter. I built this to help people understand the risks of public WiFi and how to stay safe.

**What it covers:**
- Evil twin attacks and how they work
- How to identify suspicious networks
- Best practices for public WiFi use
- Phishing awareness
- VPN recommendations
- Interactive elements that demonstrate security concepts

The page is designed to be engaging and informative without being preachy. It uses visual examples and real-world scenarios to help people understand cybersecurity concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stuff

All games are built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript - no frameworks, no dependencies, just pure web tech. They're designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Common features across games:**
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth graphics
- Local storage for high scores
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Consistent visual styling with a retro aesthetic

## üéØ Why "Virtuous Portals"?

The name is a playful take on "Evil Portals" - those captive portal pages used in penetration testing that can redirect users to malicious content. Virtuous Portals is the complete opposite! Instead of tricking people or being malicious, these are meant to be fun!

## üöÄ Getting Started

Just download any of the HTML files and open them in your browser. That's it! No installation, no setup, no complicated build processes. Each file is completely self-contained.

For the best experience:
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Full-screen mode is recommended for games
- For mobile: touch controls are built-in

## üé® Credits

All games were created by me as a fun way to practice web development and create something entertaining. The designs are inspired by classic arcade games but implemented from scratch.

The WiFi security page was created to help educate people about cybersecurity, because security awareness shouldn't be boring.

## üì± Mobile Notes

All games include mobile controls, but some work better than others on small touch screens.

## üîß Contributing

Feel free to fork, modify, or improve any of these games! They're meant to be educational examples as much as they are entertainment. If you make something cool, I'd love to see it.
